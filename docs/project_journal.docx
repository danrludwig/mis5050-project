Project Milestone 1

Project Summary:
Level Up Car Sales LLC., a small used car dealership in Ogden, Utah needs a functional
web form that will collect referral information for customers to be contacted by employees of
the dealership. As of right now they only have their phone number listed and an email for
customers to contact them. With this form they will be able to respond from multiple emails
within the company and thus respond faster to customers.
The form will collect the information and send it to a database that will record the
information and make it accessible to the dealership. The customer already has a basic website
set up and there may need to be adjustments made in order to accommodate the form. We will
also look into form services as well.
Description:
The deliverable for this project will be a functioning form on their website that will
collect information for referrals and send them to a database that is accessible to the client.
The user will enter information into the form such as name, address, phone number, email
address, etc. Upon the user hitting submit and accepting terms of being contacted by the
dealership, the information will be sent to a database that will be accessible to employees of
the dealership so they can contact the customer.
